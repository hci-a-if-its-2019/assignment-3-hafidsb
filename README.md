# Usability Evaluation and Prototyping (again)
> Usability Evaluation in this assignment is to evaluate your high-fidelity interactive-prototype with two participants:
> the participant from the previous Contextual Inquiry (CI) 
> and an additional novice-participant with different demographics if possible.
> Respectively, revise your prototype as an attempt to fix any problems found in this Usability Evaluation.

## Part A: Usability Evaluation
> In this part, you should prepare your high-fidelity interactive-prototype from the assignment 2.
> Invite the participant from your previous CI to test the prototype.
> You also need to invite one more novice participant.
> As with the CI, you might need to videotape your sessions.
> You can benefit from the videotape while writing your `Recording Transcript` later.

### 1. Brief Description of Participants

#### a. Description of Participant 1
 - Gender: Male 
 - Age: about 40's
 - Occupation: Bank Employer 
 - Reason: He's easy to be found and is pretty close to me  

#### b. Description of Participant 2
 - Gender: Male
 - Age: about 20's
 - Occupation: College student
 - Reason: He used online shopping platform often
 
### 2. Evaluation Script
#### The instructions used will use some of the previous interview (context inquiry) instruction, some of those are:
 - Find the website’s contact information
 - Find the complete Atari catalogue in the website

#### And with additional instruction as well:
- Find a way to know how to download the invoice of the purchase
- Go to the front page
 
### 3. Transcript
> Provide a summary of what the participant did and said, and what you did and said.
> If at some points you have to help the participants, because they cannot figure out what to do,
> that scene must be included in the transcript.
> It is not necessary to write down every word the participant said,
> just what is interesting and useful.
> Ensure to write down all the actions on the device, whether correct or wrong.
> Remember to supplement the transcript with time-codes or line-numbers.

#### a. Transcript with Participant 1
Me (:octocat:) with the participant (:moyai:)
 1.  :octocat:  : Instruksi pertama: cari informasi kontak pada website ini!
 2.  :moyai:     : (found it immediately) Ini yang dibawah ya?
 3.  :octocat:  : Ya benar. Instruksi selanjutnya: cari katalog lengkap di website ini!
 4.  :moyai:     : (hardly making any progress) Hmmm, gimana ini ya?
 5.  :octocat:  : Coba diutarakan pak kesulitan-kesulitannya.
 6.  :moyai:     : Hmm aku kurang paham beginian (laugh). Ini di klik-kilik gitu kan? (clicked burger icon) Oh ini ya? Muncul banyak.
 7.  :octocat:  : Bukan pak. Cari terus.
 8.  :moyai:     : (clicking first entry from burger pop up) Hmmm, ini ya? full catalogue?
 9.  :octocat:  : Yaa benar. Lanjut ke instruksi ketiga ya pak. Coba cari cara nge-download invoice di website ini!
 10. :moyai:     : Opo kui invoice?
 11. :octocat:  : Yaa semacam bukti pembayaran gitu pak. Cuma perlu cari caranya aja. Ga sampe download.
 12. :moyai:     : Ooh oke.
 13. :moyai:     : (failed to find it in a reasonable time)
 14. :octocat:  : Ooh yaudah pak ke instruksi selanjutnya aja ya. Instruksi terakhir: coba balik ke halaman awal tadi. Ke yang halaman pertama kali buka websitenya.
 15. :moyai:     : Oke.
 16. :moyai:     : (after a little while, clicked the home button) Wa ini udah awal kan?
 17. :octocat:  : Yaa betull. 

#### b. Transcript with Participant 2
Me (:octocat:) with another participant (:runner:)
 - **00:01** 👨‍🔬 You: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
 - **00:10** 👨‍💻 Participant: Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
 - **00:17** 👨‍🔬 You: when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
 - **00:25** 👨‍💻 Participant: The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.

### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis
> Record your observations per prototype screen followed by reference, feedback, incidence, reason, and resolution.

#### OBSERVATION 1

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Make it clearer thath this particular page is the home screen. 
 - **Incidence**: Can't tell wether the page mentioned is indeed a home screen
 - **Reason**: There was no indication that the page mentioned is indeed a home screen
 - **Resolution**: Add a home screen page or a welcoming messages.

## Part B: Prototyping (again)
### Sketch
> Draw a sketch of your prototype that is refined based according to the aforementioned observations on a paper.
> Afterwards, scan the sketch or make the photograph of it and attach it on this report's section.
> Please make sure the any texts on the sketch are readable.

### Design Rationale
> Please write a paragraph expressing what you have learned from the usability evaluation, 
> and how it is reflected in your design.

### High-Fidelity Interactive-Prototype
> Create a high-fidelity interactive-prototype based on the `Sketch` you have drawn.
> You can use any prototyping tools: InVision, Adobe XD, or even Microsoft PowerPoint.
